## Installation

The project is structured as a monorepo and uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) and [Yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces) for dependency management.

For initial setup use `yarn install`.

To install the project's package dependencies use `yarn run bootstrap`.

To clean the project's package dependencies use `yarn run clean`.

## Environment variables

This project uses .env files for environment variables.

To get the environment variable setup for local development you will need

- .env.development files need to added to gatsby-plugin-orion-view and gatsby-plugin-orion-edit.
- A .env file needs to added to the hasura package.

The content of the files can be found on clipperz.is

## Repo structure

The application is stored in a [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) monorepo.

### Adding a new package

When making a new package we want to make sure that gatsby doesnâ€™t do its own linting with eslint but rather uses the root level config from XO. Do do this you need an empty eslintrc.js file.

```lang javascript
// We use xo configured in the root of the monorepo. Disable eslint for gatsby.
module.exports = {}
```

Some packages are marked as `Legacy Package`. This marking indicates that they have been brought over from a previous
client-based project as part of transitioning that project into the Orion Accelerator and that those packages are potentially
subject to significant change, rename, and/or deletion as the Orion project further develops.

## Dynamicly generate static files

This project is setup to responde to changes to data by rebuilding the static content. This process has 3 moving parts.

Hasura events are setup to listen to changes in all `orion_page` tables. These events call the `content-generator-hook` lambda. The lambda starts a `generate-view-content` workflow on circleCI which ultimately runs `gatsby build` and uploads it to the s3 bucket to be served.
